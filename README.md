# nvd3-bottle-example
An example of NVd3 data viz with Bottle as a back end

# To Run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python webserver.py
```

This launches a webserver at localhost:8181 that just queries a local route and loads some simple data (that I made up and has no relevance - with some random data thrown in)
